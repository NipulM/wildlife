      "description": "Sri Lanka's protected areas, managed by the Department of Wildlife Conservation and Forest Department, play a pivotal role in biodiversity conservation. Amid habitat loss from rapid human growth and development, these zones act as refuges, prohibiting human intervention to ensure species survival. Beyond protecting biodiversity, these areas safeguard ecosystems, cultural sites, and serve as crucial reference points for monitoring environmental changes due to human impact.",
