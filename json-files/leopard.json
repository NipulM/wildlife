            "title": "Wilpattu National Park",
            "description": "Nestled in the northwestern plains of Sri Lanka, Wilpattu offers a wilder, more secluded alternative to Yala. Dense forests dominate the landscape, interspersed with natural lakes called \"villus.\" These villus attract a variety of wildlife, including leopards, elephants, water buffalo, and sambar deer. Wilpattu's leopards are known for their boldness, frequently observed resting beside the villus or ambushing prey in the open grasslands. Compared to Yala, the terrain at Wilpattu is flatter, making spotting wildlife easier.",

            "description": "Perched atop Sri Lanka's central highlands, Horton Plains is a breathtaking tapestry of rolling grasslands, misty mountains, and cascading waterfalls. While leopards are present here, their sightings are extremely rare. However, the park's unique ecosystem shelters endemic species like the Ceylon leopard cat, red-billed blue magpie, and purple-faced langur. Hiking through the plains, you might encounter herds of deer grazing amidst the misty landscapes, while breathtaking views from World's End and Baker's Fall create lasting memories.",

            "description": "A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Sinharaja is a verdant rainforest teeming with biodiversity. Leopards roam these dense jungles, though sightings are rare due to the thick foliage. However, Sinharaja is a paradise for birdwatchers, with over 150 resident species including vibrant hornbills, emerald doves, and majestic crested hawk-eagles. Other noteworthy animals include primates like toque macaques and purple-faced langurs, along with colorful butterflies and reptiles. Exploring Sinharaja involves guided nature trails, offering a tranquil escape into the heart of Sri Lanka's rainforest kingdom.",
